# SQL Portfolio by Tashinga Sakala

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This repository showcases projects I've completed as part of the Break Into Tech program by Charlotte Chaze. These projects highlight my ability to write clean, efficient SQL queries and solve real-world business problems using data. 

## About Me 

I'm a former EFL teacher turned aspiring data analyst, currently pursuing a Master of Business Administration with a focus on data analytics. With a strong foundation in Excel, SQL, and Tableau, I bring curiosity, communication skills, and a love for transforming raw data into actionable insights. 

## What You'll Find Here 

This repository includes multiple SQL projects, each in its own folder. Each Project contains: 
- Project Overview: The business context and problem being solved.
- SQL Queries: Well-commented, readable queries.
- Insights: Key takeaways from the analysis.
- Tools Used: PostgreSQL, SQLite, or other relevant tools.

## What Makes These Projects Valuable

- Business Oriented: Each project simulates real-world analytics requests. 
- Reproducible: Queries are well-organized and clearly explained. 
- Scalable: Workflows are built to handle growing datasets.
